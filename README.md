# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Collected a small dataset from google drive that contains data about diabetic patient whether a patient is diabetic or not.
As dataset contains data with output that means it's a supervised learning and has a binary output.
I applied support vector machine algorithm to make this ml model.
Used Libraries to make this model:
1) Numpy
2) Pandas
3) StandardScaler function from sklearn  (to standardize all input data)
4) svm from sklearn
5) Accuracy score from sklearn

Accuracy score of testing data: over 0.77
